        // Let's say we have an array
        const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];
        // and we want to make a copy of it.it is by reference
        const team=players;

        // You might think we can just do something like this:
         team[1]="alex";
        // however what happens when we update that array?
        // the original array is already changed
        // now here is the problem!

        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
         // we will use slice to make a copy
           const team2=players.slice();
        // one way
        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
            //! :)) that is a good way that I didn't understand
           const team3 = [].concat(players);
        // or use the new ES6 Spread using spread function
           const team4 = [...players];
        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
            const team5 = Array.from(players);
        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
        // because they are copied by refernce too
        // with Objects
        const person = {
          name: "Wes Bos",
          age: 80
        };

        // and think we make a copy:
              const copyobject=person;
        // how do we take a copy instead?
        //this is needs deep clone // 2 level deep object
        const wes = {
        name: 'Wes',
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: '@wesbos',
          facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
        }
      };
        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
            const shallowCopy1 = Object.assign({}, wes ,{Number:30});
            const shallowCopy2={...wes};

              //also clonedeep
            const deepcopy2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));

        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
